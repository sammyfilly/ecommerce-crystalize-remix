Creating a full-fledged platform like Vercel is a complex task that would require a team of experienced engineers and significant resources. However, I can provide you with a simple example of how you might structure a basic web server using Node.js, which is a technology commonly used for web applications like Vercel.

Please note that this is a highly simplified example and does not cover all the features and complexity of a service like Vercel. A real-world production system would be much more involved.

```javascript
const http = require('http');

// Create a basic HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') {
    // Respond with a basic HTML page
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
    res.end('<html><body>Hello, Vercel-like server!</body></html>');
  } else {
    // Handle 404 errors
    res.writeHead(404, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end('Not Found');
  }
});

// Listen on port 3000
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

This code creates a basic HTTP server using Node.js that listens on port 3000. When you access it in a web browser, it will respond with a simple "Hello, Vercel-like server!" message for the root URL ("/"). Any other URL will result in a "Not Found" response.

Please remember that building a platform like Vercel requires expertise in various technologies, including cloud infrastructure, database management, security, and more. This example is just a very basic starting point. A 20-year engineer would be involved in much more complex and robust development work for such a platform.
